in chronological order of writing:
1. bus_lines - program to assist moovit-like apps, sorting bus lines by various input parameters (i.e. distance, line name)
2. markov_chain - generic programming implementation of markov chain method of data stringing (with use of probability)
3. tweets_generator - first use of markov chain: a statistical program which receives a document of tweets as input and outputs markov chain generated tweets based off of position and occurance of words
4. snakes_and_ladders - second use of markov chain: a statistical program that generates games of snakes and ladders via generic markov chain
5. matrix, activation, dense, mlpnetwork - classes written for use in output generation (as well as final data processing) in a neural network - identifying pictures of numbers

note: only #5 was written in c++
